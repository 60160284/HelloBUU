                <h1> Sundial </h1>

    
                From Wikipedia, the <em>free encyclopedia.</em>


                <p><strong>A sundial measures time by the position of the sun.</strong> The most commonly seen designs, such as the
                <em>'ordinary' </em>or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of
                the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However,
                sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.
                <br>
                Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure standard
                and daylight saving time, as well.</p>
                
                <h2> History </h2>
            
                <p>Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) are <strong>known from ancient
                Egypt,</strong> and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman
                cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament
                (Isaiah 38:2).<br>
                
                The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have
                invented a <strong>universal sundial </strong>that could be used <em>anywhere on Earth</em>. The French astronomer Oronce
                Fine constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published
                a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and 
                laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio 
                instrumenti ad horologia solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying 
                illustrations.</p>
                
                <h2> Installation of standard sundials </h2>
            
                <p>Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By tilting such a 
                sundial, it may be installed so that it will <em>keep time</em>. However, some mass-produced garden 
                sundials are inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected. A sundial designed for 
                one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base so that its style 
                or gnomon is<strong> parallel</Strong> to the Earth's axis of <em>rotation</em>, so that it points at the north celestial
                pole in the northern hemisphere, or the south celestial pole in the southern hemisphere.
                
                A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow 
                geographic and political<em> boundaries</em>. A sundial can be rotated around its style or gnomon (which
                must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a 
                rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west suffices.
                
                To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. 
                An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for 
                winter. <em>Rotating </em>the sundial will not work well because most sundials do not have equal hour 
                angles.
                
                Ordinary sundials do not correct apparent solar time to clock time. There is a 15 minute 
                variation through the year, known as the equation of time, because the Earth's orbit is 
                slightly elliptical and its axis is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit. A quality 
                sundial will include a <strong>permanently-mounted table</strong> or <strong>graph</strong> giving this correction for at least 
                each month of the year. Some more-complex sundials have curved hour-lines, curved gnomons or 
                other arrangements to directly display the clock time.</p>

      <p>There are 3 types of lists:</p><br>
      <p>definitino lists</p> 
      <pre>
      which show terms and definitions </pre>
      <p>unordered lists</p>
      <pre>
      which show bullets </pre>
      <p>ordered lists</p>
      <pre>
      which show numbers or letters</pre>
     <p>Adove is an example of a definnition list.</p><br>

     <p>unordered list can have a type attribute
     which can be applied to the UL or the LI teg.
     Thethree values allowed are:</p>
     <ul >
         <li>type = "square"</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="b">
             <li>type = "disc"</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="a">
             <li>type = "circle"</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Ordered lists can have a type attribute too.
         Used along with a start attribute they can show:
      </p>
      <ol class="d">
             <li>lower case letters</li>
